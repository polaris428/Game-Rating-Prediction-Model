Players have control over some of Walker's characteristics such as their gender, skills and attire.  Walker wields various firearms and tools to fight against enemies, including traditional guns like a shotgun and pistol, the boomerang-like Wingstick and sci-fi weapons like the Grav-Dart Launcher. Over the course of the game, players will acquire new skills and abilities, like Overdrive, which significantly increases the power and effectiveness of their attacks, Shatter, which pushes back enemies, and Slam, which propels Walker in the air before slamming down onto enemies, dealing damage and throwing them back.  Enemies in RAGE 2 consist of different types of human bandits, human-sized mutants, cyborg mutants and enormous super mutants.  RAGE 2 also features vehicular combat and racing, with the player being able to drive any vehicle in the game world.  ",59.99

As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., “Anything goes in this sex andron”; “That is love, this is commerce. What are you into?”); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game.  ",59.99

Inc,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","['English', 'Japanese']",34.0,Adventure," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This is visual novel in which players assume the role of a high-school student investigating a series of mysterious deaths in Tokyo. Some scenes depict still images of characters engaged in violent acts: characters threatening people with knives, strangling other characters, and involved in torture. Crime scenes are graphically depicted with extensive blood-splatter and large amounts of text detail. Corpses are frequently depicted with bloodstains and sometimes mangled fingers, dangling entrails, or exposed brains. The game also contains sexual material, in still images and text; references to sexual fetishes and masturbation. Still images also depict partially exposed breasts and buttocks. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in dialogue.  ",34.99
